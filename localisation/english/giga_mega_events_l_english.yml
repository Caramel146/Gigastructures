    giga_dialog.1207.a.desc:0 "With the mirror frame now finished around [giga_system.GetName], we can finally start our preparations to use it as a bomb.\n\nWe'll have to let it accumulate energy for a few years, then it will gain the ability to be detonated. Everything in the system will be destroyed, and the explosion will be so powerful it propagates through hyperlanes. Every planet in neighboring systems will be rendered uninhabitable from the flow of energy, and every planet two jumps away will be irradiated. Most importantly, it will send a shockwave through subspace, disturbing and rearranging hyperlanes from up to 4 jumps away!"
    giga_dialog.1207.b.desc:0 "With the mirror frame now finished around [giga_system.GetName], we can finally start our preparations to stabilize it and use it for energy production.\n\nIts output will be relatively mediocre (250 £energy£), but it might be possible to stabilize it once we get the appropriate techs."

    giga_dialog.1207.a:0 "It will be a fine instrument of destruction."
    giga_dialog.1207.b:0 "Soon, its full power shall be ours."

    giga_dialog.3401.desc:0 "The construction site for a future $name_fusion_suppressor$ has successfully been constructed in the [giga_system.GetName] system. It'll house the infrastructure required to begin constructing a $name_fusion_suppressor$, capable of modifying the very processes within a star."
    giga_dialog.3401.a:0 "Great."
  
    giga_dialog.3402.name:0 "Gravity Modulators Built"
    giga_dialog.3402.desc:0 "Our engineers have finished constructing the large array of gravity modulators of our $name_fusion_suppressor$ around [giga_system.GetName]. These bulky devices are able to generate an artificial gravitational field to compress an entire star and alter its internal fusion processes."
    giga_dialog.3402.a:0 "Wonderful."
  
    giga_dialog.3403.name:0 "Stellar Stabilizers Built"
    giga_dialog.3403.desc:0 "The Stellar Stabilizers of our $name_fusion_suppressor$ around [giga_system.GetName] are now complete. They are able to stabilize the star while the Gravity Modulators generate the artificial gravitational field. Now, we may begin the actual process of compressing the star to eventually destroy it, or turn it into a Black Hole."
    giga_dialog.3403.a:0 "Amazing."
  
    giga_dialog.3404.name:0 "Stellar Compression - Stage I"
    giga_dialog.3404.desc:0 "Our $name_fusion_suppressor$ has successfully begun to compress [giga_system.GetName]. The star's fusion processes have been altered and a powerful gravitational field has been generated, shrinking the star's apparent volume. The many effects this has had on the stellar plasma is being studied by various laboratories within the $name_fusion_suppressor$."
    giga_dialog.3404.a:0 "Marvelous."
  
    giga_dialog.3405.name:0 "Stellar Compression - Stage II"
    giga_dialog.3405.desc:0 "The $name_fusion_suppressor$ has yet again compressed [giga_system.GetName] to an even smaller volume. Interesting phenomenons have arisen within the star, yielding great scientific returns, and the star is starting to behave in physics-defying ways. Further compression will lead to more results."
    giga_dialog.3405.a:0 "Great."
  
    giga_dialog.3406.name:0 "Stellar Compression - Neutron Star"
    giga_dialog.3406.desc:0 "The $name_fusion_suppressor$ has now compressed [giga_system.GetName] to such an extent that protons and electrons within the star's core have fused and become neutrons, transforming the core into a neutron star, surrounded by a layer of exotic stellar plasma.\n\nWe can now keep the star as it is, yielding physics and engineering research. Alternatively, we can further compress the star, transforming it into an artificial Black Hole, yielding physics research. Finally, the $name_fusion_suppressor$ can release all gravitational compression and exert a repulsive force, causing the repulsive forces within the star's core to detonate the star into a supernova, destroying the $name_fusion_suppressor$ and depositing a new strategic resource on the surface of this solar system's planets, which can be used to create powerful buildings."

    giga_dialog.3409.title:0 "Supernova"
    giga_dialog.3409.desc:0 "The $name_fusion_suppressor$ has released all gravitational fields exerted on the star and has began applying a negative gravitational field.\nWithin seconds, the intense repulsive forces within the star's neutron core overcome the natural gravitational field, and the boiling energies of a superdense star are suddenly unshackled.\nThe star begins to glow brighter and seems to pulse for a few seconds, before the outer layers of the star are suddenly ejected at relativistic speeds by the repulsive forces. In a matter of hours, every planet in the system is glassed by the enormous wave of energy, stripping them of their surfaces and atmospheres.\nIodizium deposits have formed on the now-molten planets, ready to be harvested and used."
    giga_dialog.3409.a:0 "Marvelous!"
  
    giga_dialog.3410.title:0 "Black Hole"
    giga_dialog.3410.desc:0 "The $name_fusion_suppressor$ has intensified its artificial gravitational field to its maximum.
