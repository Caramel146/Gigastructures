    giga_dialog.1207.a.desc:0 "With the mirror frame now finished around [giga_system.GetName], we can finally start our preparations to use it as a bomb.\n\nWe'll have to let it accumulate energy for a few years, then it will gain the ability to be detonated. Everything in the system will be destroyed, and the explosion will be so powerful it propagates through hyperlanes. Every planet in neighboring systems will be rendered uninhabitable from the flow of energy, and every planet two jumps away will be irradiated. Most importantly, it will send a shockwave through subspace, disturbing and rearranging hyperlanes from up to 4 jumps away!"
    giga_dialog.1207.b.desc:0 "With the mirror frame now finished around [giga_system.GetName], we can finally start our preparations to stabilize it and use it for energy production.\n\nIts output will be relatively mediocre (250 £energy£), but it might be possible to stabilize it once we get the appropriate techs."

Alternatively, we can further compress the star, transforming it into an artificial Black Hole, yielding physics research. Finally, the $name_fusion_suppressor$ can release all gravitational compression and exert a repulsive force, causing the repulsive forces within the star's core to detonate the star into a supernova, destroying the $name_fusion_suppressor$ and depositing a new strategic resource on the surface of this solar system's planets, which can be used to create powerful buildings."

    giga_dialog.3409.desc:0 "The $name_fusion_suppressor$ has released all gravitational fields exerted on the star and has began applying a negative gravitational field.\nWithin seconds, the intense repulsive forces within the star's neutron core overcome the natural gravitational field, and the boiling energies of a superdense star are suddenly unshackled.\nThe star begins to glow brighter and seems to pulse for a few seconds, before the outer layers of the star are suddenly ejected at relativistic speeds by the repulsive forces. In a matter of hours, every planet in the system is glassed by the enormous wave of energy, stripping them of their surfaces and atmospheres.\nIodizium deposits have formed on the now-molten planets, ready to be harvested and used."
