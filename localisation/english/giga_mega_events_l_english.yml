# Dyson Sphere partially completed
    giga_dialog.40041.desc:0 "Progress on the [From.From.GetName] Dyson Sphere continues, with the further installation of more of the advanced solar harvesters we have increased the benefits of the Dyson Sphere.\n\nThe energy gains have reached 50% of the projected maximum value of the completed work."
    giga_dialog.40042.desc:0 "With the addition of another set of solar harvesting panels, We have nearly finished the Dyson Sphere being bult in the [From.From.GetName] system.\n\nThe structure is now outputting 75% of the projected maximum output for a star of this size.\n\nSoon the full power of the star itself will be at our fingertips."

    #Penrose Sphere Bomb/stable
    giga_dialog.1207.title:0 "Purpose of the $name_penrose$"
    giga_dialog.1207.a.desc:0 "With the mirror frame now finished around [giga_system.GetName], we can finally start our preparations to use it as a bomb.\n\nWe'll have to let it accumulate energy for a few years, then it will gain the ability to be detonated. Everything in the system will be destroyed, and the explosion will be so powerful it propagates through hyperlanes. Every planet in neighboring systems will be rendered uninhabitable from the flow of energy, and every planet two jumps away will be irradiated. Most importantly, it will send a shockwave through subspace, disturbing and rearranging hyperlanes from up to 4 jumps away!"
    giga_dialog.1207.b.desc:0 "With the mirror frame now finished around [giga_system.GetName], we can finally start our preparations to stabilize it and use it for energy production.\n\nIts output will be relatively mediocre (250 £energy£), but it might be possible to stabilize it once we get the appropriate techs."

    giga_dialog.1207.a:0 "It will be a fine instrument of destruction."
    giga_dialog.1207.b:0 "Soon, its full power shall be ours."
