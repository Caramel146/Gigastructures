    fusion_suppressor_2:0 "$name_fusion_suppressor$ Stellar Stabilizers"
    fusion_suppressor_2_DESC:0 "The $name_fusion_suppressor$ is now capable of stabilizing the star its built around, thus letting the gravity modulators compress the stellar object without it suddenly exploding from being destabilized."
  
    fusion_suppressor_3:0 "$name_fusion_suppressor$ - Compression Stage I"
    fusion_suppressor_3_DESC:0 "The $name_fusion_suppressor$ has started compressing the star's matter, opening up research opportunities on the nature of stellar nuclear reactions. Further compression will yield more research."
  
    fusion_suppressor_4:0 "$name_fusion_suppressor$ - Compression Stage II"
    fusion_suppressor_4_DESC:0 "The star has been once again compressed, and its base components are starting to show odd behaviors holding high scientific potentials. More exotic fusion reactions are beginning to take place, while the very structure of the star itself seems to degrade."

    fusion_suppressor_5_DESC:0 "The $name_fusion_suppressor$ has managed to compress the star so much that protons and electrons have fused to become neutrons within the star's core, transforming said core into a neutron star. This is effectively a neutron star surrounded by regular stellar plasma."
  
    fusion_suppressor_6:0 "Collapse Star into Blackhole"
    fusion_suppressor_6_DESC:0 "The star's matter has now been collapsed to such an extent that even light cannot escape the body's gravitational pull, effectively transforming it into an artificial Black Hole, possessing incredible research potential."

    fusion_suppressor_6b_DESC:0 "Order the $name_fusion_suppressor$ to release the gravitational field and exert a repulsive force, causing the compressed star to detonate in a devastating supernova, destroying the $name_fusion_suppressor$. Any planet smaller than 5, as well as asteroids, will be destroyed, and gas giants will be striped of their atmosphere. The surviving planets will get Iodizium deposits, which are crystals generated by the artificial supernova slamming into planets at relativistic speeds. These crystals can be used to construct powerful buildings on our planets."
