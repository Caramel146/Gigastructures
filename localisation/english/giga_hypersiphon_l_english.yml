 giga_tech_shroud_conduit:0 "Direct Shroud Connections"
 giga_tech_shroud_conduit_desc:0 "After much meditation and study, our telepaths believe that it may be possible to open stable tunnels into the realm known as the Shroud. Though sub-atomic in scale, controlled use of these tunnels would allow our psionic population to benefit from energies otherwise restricted to dangerous and expensive rituals."

 giga_tech_psychic_hypersiphon:0 "Opening The Doorway"
 giga_tech_psychic_hypersiphon_desc:0 "The Shroud is a strange realm. By combining new containment technologies with immense telepathic power, it might become possible to directly link our reality with that of the Shroud on a macroscopic scale. Doing so might improve our Shroud Conduits greatly, bringing our prosperity to new heights. Potential for bleedthrough of unwanted energies is theorised to be unavoidable, but minimal at worst."

 giga_dialog.1401.name:0 "$name_psy_siphon$ Site Built"
 giga_dialog.1401.desc:0 "Our advanced telepaths and engineers have assembled the construction site for our future massive Psychic Hypersiphon, which will drain energy out of the Shroud itself! It will take lots of effort and sweat to finish it, but the end results are going to be worth it."
 giga_dialog.1401.a:0 "Great!"

 giga_dialog.1402.name:0 "$name_psy_siphon$ Frame Built"
 giga_dialog.1402.desc:0 "The containment frame of the $name_psy_siphon$ is now in place! It has been designed to contain a ball of pure boiling psychic energy taking the form of a star, and many labs have been incorporated into the frame to further study the Shroud. We shall now begin constructing the actual equipment used to open the portal itself."
 giga_dialog.1402.a:0 "Wonderful."

 giga_dialog.1403.name:0 "$name_psy_siphon$ Spire Built"
 giga_dialog.1403.desc:0 "The portal spire of the $name_psy_siphon$ is finished. This massive equipment, along with the portal capacitors, will emit a powerful burst of psionic energy, powerful enough to tear spacetime apart and open a hole to the Shroud! The portal will obviously not be stable enough to permit physical access to the Shroud, but lots of energy will begin pouring out of it to be collected by the portal spire. The only thing left to do now is to turn it on..."
 giga_dialog.1403.a:0 "Excellent!"

 giga_dialog.1404.name:0 "$name_psy_siphon$ Portal Activated"
 giga_dialog.1404.desc:0 "The great portal linking our reality with the Shroud near [giga_system.GetName] has been fully activated! Pure energy is now pouring out of this artificial gate to the psychic realm, and our telepaths are already feeling the great boon that this direct link is granting their psionic abilities! Some skeptical elements of our society are worried this portal could attract 'unwanted attention', but our scientists have proven that interdimensional travel is strictly impossible, and they assure us that the portal is too energetic to allow any organized being to pass through it.\n\n\n...Right?...\n\n\n§R...prey...§!"
 giga_dialog.1404.a:0 "Marvelous!"

The circular frame in the middle will hold and stabilize a small \"star\" made from pure psychic energy, in order to generate wondrous amounts of credits. Laboratories are also integrated in the hull, to closely study the ethereal nature of psychic energy."
